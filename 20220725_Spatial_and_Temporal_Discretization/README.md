PPT and its corresponding .pdf file are in the root directory. 

All images in the ppt are placed in  `./pic`.

Python codes and demo videos are in the `./demo` . 

## Run the code

The operating environment is

```shell
[Taichi] version 1.0.0, llvm 10.0.0, win, python 3.9.12 
[Taichi] Starting on arch=x64
```

The code is not tested, but it should work properly cross-platform.

If taichi is not installed in your environment, you can install it with the following command:

```shell
python -m pip install taichi
```

Then you can run the code through:

```shell
python ./explicit_fem_2d.py
python ./explicit_mass_spring_2d.py
python ./explicit_fem_3d.py
```
